Dancing Shoes
Installation Instructions


Main Library:

Dancing Shoes is a python library, that needs to be accessible
from your python scripts.

If you want to use it only from within FontLab Studio, you can copy
the folder "dancingshoes" to your FontLab's modules folder at
[...]/FontLab/Studio 5/Macros/System/Modules/

Alternatively, you can copy it to your Python's site-packages folder,
to make it accesible system-wide.
On the Mac, this is usually located at /Library/Python/2.3/site-packages/
(change the 2.3 to your preferred version of Python that you're using).
On Windows, this folder could be located at c:\Python24\site-packages,
but you probably know where to find it.


FontLab Sample Script:

The sample script DancingShoesInFontLab.py from the "Sample Files" folder
belongs in your FontLabs Macro folder at [...]/FontLab/Studio 5/Macros/
to make it accessible in FontLab's Macro toolbar.
